# dotfiles

This repo contains my dev configuration and the scripts needed to get everything installed and ready to go.

Always a WIP and changing every day :)

## Setup instructions

This repo is targeted for MacOS/Ubuntu. Many of the tools I use are cross platform and you should be able to get everything working on any OS, but you will be on your own ðŸ«¡.

The basic idea is your configuration files all live in ~/.dotfiles and are symlinked to the appropriate config location for each application.

See this blog for details: https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:jollyjerr/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

cd .dotfiles
make stow # this links all the files to their appropriate location

cd ..
make dotfiles # this downloads _all the things_
```
